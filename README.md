# Vertical Slice Architecture Example

This is a code example of the differences the vertical slice architecture brings to development
compared to traditional layered approaches.

## Getting Started

Make sure to have at least .Net Core 2.1 installed.
You should simply be able to pull down latest, build, and run locally.

### Prerequisites

.Net Core 2.1

## Running the tests

We have a simple xUnit test suite that can be run.

## Built With

* ASP.NET Core MVC
* [Mediatr](https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR) - Mediator Pattern Implementation
* [FeatureFolders](https://github.com/OdeToCode/AddFeatureFolders) - Feature centric grouping
* [Highway.Data](https://github.com/HighwayFramework/Highway.Data) - Persistence layer
